# Optimal Resistance Calculation for Shunt Circuit and Bimorph Euler-Bernoulli Beam

This repository contains an application that utilizes C++ and Python programs to calculate the optimal resistance of a shunt circuit coupled with a bimorph Euler-Bernoulli beam with piezoelectric layers. The beam is subjected to base excitation. The program generates a dataset and trains a neural network to estimate the optimal resistance for the circuit.

## Features

- C++ program: Calculates the optimal resistance based on the provided input parameters for the shunt circuit and the bimorph Euler-Bernoulli beam.
- Python program: Generates a dataset by simulating various excitation conditions and corresponding optimal resistance values.
- Neural Network Training: Trains a neural network using the generated dataset to estimate the optimal resistance for different excitation scenarios.
